## listening and lifting others up

As my sister is graduating from grad school and soon beginning life as a Physician's Assistant, I can't help but notice that her immadiate family does not fully respect her expertise and knowledge in the field she studied in for 8+ years.

I put myself in that position and thought _What if my friends and family constantly belittled my knowledge?_ I wanted to make things right and I told my sister that I would respect her knowledge and not toss it aside. I wonder if I went into that same field, if i would also get similar treatment? I doubt it.

It would take some work to make things right but it starts with one person respecting someone's knowledge for others to follow suit. You have to respect someone that has actually spent countless hours studying, preparing, taking exams, and shadowing others in the field. If not now, when would you begin to take her seriously? When she finds a job? I think it should have been sooner. Telling someone who was studying hard and who made top of the class, that they are completely wrong is just plain ignorant and disrepsectful. I want to make my sister feel empowered and feel like she can talk about the things she had worked so hard to become an expert at.

I feel she would do that same thing for me, if our roles were reversed.
