## New Book

Over the weekend, I ordered the book "_Working in Public, The making and maintenance of open source software_" by _Nadia Edghbal_, which was actually referred by Tom Preston-Werner. I attended an online meetup meeting about [Redwood.js](https://redwoodjs.com/) and Tom had mentioned the book. I also remember seeing the book was recently published via Twitter but I just never ordered it.

I got to the Chapter 3 of the book and I have already learned a lot about the history of _Free and Open Source Software_ and how the community got to it's point today. As someone who has been following community members in the JavaScript world on Twitter, I can definitely see this book being very accurate. Nadia really has captured my attention for 70 pages and I am excited to continue reading more about OSS.

Keep the code Free and Open!
